## Overview

Gesture-Based Volume Control is a project that allows users to control the volume of their devices using hand gestures. This innovative solution leverages computer vision and gesture recognition technologies to provide a hands-free and intuitive experience for adjusting audio volume.

## Features

- **Gesture Recognition:** Utilizes computer vision algorithms to recognize hand gestures.
- **Volume Control:** Maps specific gestures to volume control actions, enabling users to increase or decrease the volume effortlessly.
- **Real-time Feedback:** Provides real-time visual or audio feedback to users indicating the recognized gesture and corresponding volume adjustment.



## Technologies Used

- **OpenCV:** Computer vision library for gesture recognition.
- **Python:** Main programming language for implementing the gesture-based volume control.
